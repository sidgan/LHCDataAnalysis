{"name":"Lhcdataanalysis","tagline":"","body":"## Proposed Schedule\r\n\r\n### Plots \r\n1. Make plots for naccess, nusers, totcpu distributions. \r\n1. Apply a cut to facilitate conversion of dataframes to binary.\r\n\r\n### Popularity metric\r\n1. Define numeric naccess, nusers, totcpu for popularity metrics. These have been plotted on log scale. \r\n\r\n### Machine Learning Algorithm\r\n1. Run any ML algorithm and make predictions for any arbitrary period of time.\r\n2. Check efficiency and make plots for efficiency. \r\n\r\n### Spark\r\n1. Installation of Apache Spark. \r\n2. Apply a pipeline of the above on Apache Spark platform.\r\n3. Calculate efficiency.\r\n\r\n### Rolling Forecast\r\n1. Make future predictions based on past and present analysis trends. \r\n2. Understand rolling forecasts and apply them on LHC data. \r\n3. Use drift to extrapolate a predicted line indicating future between the past and present values. \r\n4. Apply filters like Kalman filters and HARRV model. \r\n5. Find degree of uncertainty. \r\n6. Use reduced data, decrease details so that speed and accuracy is increased. \r\n7. Check for seasonal biasing. \r\n\r\n### Ensembles\r\n1. Try possible ensembles on different platforms and calculate efficiency.\r\n","google":"UA-59744528-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
